title: Six Principles for Making New Things
---
Paul Graham's 'Six Principles for Making New Things' maybe written more than 8 years ago. But I found that it is still relevant and valid. Why?

Hereâ€™s the juicy bit:

> I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly.

[Read the rest](https://go.gizipp.com/http://www.paulgraham.com/newthings.html)

## 1. Always find simple solution, don't overcomplicated

If you have a problem, then you need find a solution. Whether it complicated or simple problem, you need to find a simple solution.

It must be simple. 

And it must be solution. 

Not another problem.

## 2. Overlooked problem, don't overwhelmed with the solution.

There are a lot of chance that overwhelmed create something new, but the urgency solve is non crucial.
